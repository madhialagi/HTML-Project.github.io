Building a website with only HTML involves structuring content using tags like headings, paragraphs, images, and links. It creates a simple, static site with no styling or interactive features. HTML forms the backbone of webpages, defining their structure, but lacks design (handled by CSS) or dynamic behavior (enabled with JavaScript).
